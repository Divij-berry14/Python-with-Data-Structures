# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

#In this what we are doing is that, we are taking the particular value of the arr and treated them an an index. And then
# we are going to that index and making it negative. If some other element again get to that position and see if it is negative
# then it means it is already visited by some element means the number is occuring twice.
