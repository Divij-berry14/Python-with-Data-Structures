# Spanning Tree- A tree with n vertices and n-1 edges with no cycle and form a tree is called Spanning Tree
# Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)- A tree with n vertices and n-1 edges with no cycle and form a tree with minimum sum of edges.
#Kruskal Algorithm -  It is used to find the MST of the graph. In this algo, you will select the edges with minimum
#weights and form a MST
